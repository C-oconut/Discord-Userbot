# Discord-bot
A simple bot I wrote for people aiming to learn.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.2+
- Discord.py Library(https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- Windows 7+ 32bit/64bit(Sorry, mac seems to not work. **Hasnt been tested on linux.**)

## Setup

Make sure you have all the requirements. 
Go to (https://discordapp.com/developers) and create an application. 
Make sure your application is a **BOT** account. 
Get the **token** and save it somewhere in a text-editor. 
On this **repo**, there's a nice green button that says, "**download**". 
Click it, save to your desktop and extract zip file to desktop.
Open up, ``bot.py`` and set the **Description** to the name of your
bot. Then, set the **Prefix** as anything that you want. 

On **line 43** do the following: 

Get your token and place it in, "YOUR TOKEN HERE"
For example if my token was, "shdahsdh1dh712y2d1h"
You would do this: 

```
bot.run("shdahsdh1dh712y2d1h")
```

After you're done, save and exit. 
Click **Start.bat** and you should be good to go. 
However, in order to invite your bot to your server, please do the following:
``https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOURBOTSCLIENTID&scope=bot&permissions=0``
Replace the, "YOURBOTSCLIENTID" with the **client id** which can be found in your application. 
Enjoy!:)
